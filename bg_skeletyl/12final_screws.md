# Installing the splinky shield

{: .note }
We will detail only one side, as the other side is the same, but symmetric.

**For the following step, please prepare:**
- keyboard assembly (x2)
- M4 screw (x2)

{: .note }
On the pictures, we use a Splinktegrated - those come with premium kits. The Splinky + Shield works exactly the same, so inspect the pictures carefully.
