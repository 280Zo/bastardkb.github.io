## Is your design based on the Dactyl ?

Yes, my Bastard Keyboards use the same key placement as the Dactyl.

This way, my PCBs can also be used for Dactyl-like keyboards, if you don't want to get a full Kit.

## Can you share the code / 3d files?

My keyboards are designed in CAD software, so there is no code per se.

At this moment I cannot share the 3d files, because I rely on those kits to make the company live, and continue innovating and putting out better products.

I open-source as many things as possible and slowly add more designs.
Check the [Github page](https://github.com/Bastardkb/).

## Can I buy just the case?

The Bastard Keyboard kit is meant as a tight, controlled experience. Selling the case without the PCBs and everything that goes around it doesn't make sense.

I want all my customers to have a great build experience, and going with handwire is not part of it.

## Why are there lead times ?

As I am constantly innovating, my designs are slowly changing over time.

By building the keyboards specifically for each order, I make sure you have the latest version with all the improvements.

3d printing is in itself a slow technology that involves delay (look at Prusa), but I am working hard to reduce the lead times as much as possible !
