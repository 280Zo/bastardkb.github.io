## Is your design based on the Dactyl ?

Yes, our Bastard Keyboards use the same key placement as the Dactyl.

This way, our PCBs can also be used for Dactyl-like keyboards, if you don't want to get a full Kit.

## Can you share the code / 3d files?

Our keyboard was designed in CAD software, so there is no code per se.

At this moment we cannot share the 3d files, because we rely on those kits to make the company live, and continue innovating and putting out better products.

We open-source as many things as possible and slowly add more designs.
Check our [Github page](https://github.com/HID-Technologies).

## Can I buy just the case?

The Bastard Keyboard kit is meant as a tight, controlled experience. Selling the case without the PCBs and everything that goes around it doesn't make sense.

We want all our customers to have a great build experience, and going with handwire is not part of it.

## Why are there lead times ?

As we are constantly innovating, our designs are slowly changing over time.

By building the keyboards specifically for each order, we make sure you have the latest version with all the improvements.

3d printing is in itself a slow technology that involves delay (look at Prusa), but we are working hard to reduce the lead times as much as possible !
