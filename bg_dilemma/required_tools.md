Before starting the build, check that you have all the required tools:

- Soldering iron
- Soldering tin
- TX8 Torx screw driver (a flat head will also work)
- TX10 Torx screw driver (a flat head will also work)

We also recommend the following tools:

- desoldering pump (mistakes happen)

Also make sure to check the contents of the package carefully to make sure that everything is there.
