# Preparing the 3d holder assembly
## Top housing - screw inserts

![](../assets/pics/guides/charybdis/51.jpg)

**For the following step, please prepare:**

- 3d printed bottom housing (x1)
- M3 screw insert (x3)

{: .tip }
There are 2 sizes of screw inserts in your kit. In this step, we will use the small ones.

- Install the 3 screw inserts
- **Use the same method as for the case**
- Let gravity do the work
- Push it 2/3 of the way in, then flip it and push flush against a flat surface

Depending on your kit, the bottom housing might look slightly different. The process to prepare it and install it is the same.

## Bottom housing - bearings

![](../assets/pics/guides/charybdis/55.jpg)

**For the following step, please prepare:**

- 3d printed bottom housing (x1)
- M3 screw (x3)
- M3 bearing (x3)

**For each of the 3 bearings:**

- Install the bearing in its spot
- Screw in the M3 torx screw
- Make sure it can rotate freely. If not, unscrew by half a turn and check again

# Spin the ball
- If you printed the case yourself, the bearings might scratch a bit against the 3d print and not roll correctly
- Rest the trackball on top of the 3 bearings
- Place your palm on top of the trackball
- Applying gentle pressure, make a circle movement, make sure you can hear the bearings rotating
- Do this for around 30 seconds, or until the trackball feels smooth


# Installing the 3d holder assembly

## Top part

- Insert the top sensor holder assembly into the case
- The top sensor holder assembly has a specific way of being inserted
- Locate the side with a cut part
- Install it from the top of the keyboard, by pushing in the opposite side first. Use the picture below to check correct insertion

Push in the other side. It will scrap a little bit against the case.

## Bottom part

{: .tip }
Depending on your kit, the bottom housing might look slightly different. Install the screws to match the picture below.

- Insert the bottom part of the assembly from under the case
- Screw in the 3 screws
- Make sure it's tight, but do not overtighten - you might damage the print
- The whole assembly should not move at all

**For the following step, please prepare:**
- keyboard assembly
- sensor PCB assembly

// TODO

# Installing the sensor PCB

- Install the sensor PCB on top of the holder, aligning the two holes of the PCB with the two holes of the holder
- Screw in the sensor PCB using 2 M3 torx screws
- Use the picture below for reference
