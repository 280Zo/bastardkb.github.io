# Introduction

Welcome to the official Bastard Keyboards documentation website.

Just like the rest of BK's work, this wiki is open-source - with the files on github. This wiki is hosted by Github Pages. Contributions are welcome!

We recommend first checking out the [FAQ page][faq], which contains answers to commonly asked questions like bluetooth and hotswap.

# What you will find here

**Use the left menu to navigate. You will find:**
- build guides for all keyboards*
- detailed troubleshooting tips to help you debug your build
- answers to frequently asked questions
- recommendations for 3d printing your own model
- help on customizing your firmware

*If you are building the TBK Mini, use the Skeletyl build guide. If you are building a Charybdis Mini, use the Charybdis Nano build guide.

**Additionally, we have a youtube channel.**
On it, you will find:
- video build guides for the keyboards
- tips and advice on designing your own case
- explanations on how to use your keyboard
- build logs and progress VLogs
