Here you can find build guides, information on the kits I offer, frequently asked questions, and software for my keyboards.

## Getting started

You just got your keyboard, great ! Now what ?

### Building the keyboard

If you have ordered a DIY kit, the first thing to do is to build it. Check the [build guides](http://docs.bastardkb.com/build%20guides/).

If you have a prebuilt, just add your keycaps on it and go to the next section !

If you have any problems, you can ask me by email, through the website or on [Discord](http://bastardkb.com/discord)

### Customizing the software

By default, the keyboards come pre-flashed with qmk. [Check the keymaps here](http://docs.bastardkb.com/rgb.html).

If you want to modify it, you can clone qmk and modify the folder `keyboards/bastardkb/`.
