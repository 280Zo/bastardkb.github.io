# Introduction

Now that everything is connected together, the next step is to install the switches and the PCBs into the case.

{: .note }
You may have noticed that we still haven't done anything with the sensor PCB. This is normal, we will connect it after installing the switches. This is so that it doesn't get in the way when soldering the switches.

{: .note }
We will detail only the left side, as the right side is the same, but symmetric.

While in theory you can install the switches in any order you like, we outline below what we found out works best.


{: .warning }
The case is made of plastic, and will melt if you touch it with your soldering iron. Be careful!

# Installing the switches

We will start by detailing a technique to install the switches, and then in which order they should be installed. **Please read this whole section first to familiarize yourself, and then proceed to the installation.** Otherwise, the process might be more complicated.

When installing the switches, use the following technique:
- press the PCB against the case, and try to align it as much as possible
- from the other side, push the switch into the case hole
- make sure the pins align into the PCB's holes
- make sure the PCB is flush against the switch. If your switch has side pins, you may have to push it a bit harder
- solder the two pins of the switch

{: .warning }
Make sure to install the left-side PCB assembly (5 keys on the thumb cluster) into the left case, and the right-side assembly (3 keys on the thumb cluster) into the right case.

- start with the top row
- continue with the bottom row
- finally, install the rest of the switches
