# Testing before case installation

Now is a great time to function test the assembled PCBs, as any troubleshooting steps you might need to complete will be much easier to do while the plates are still outside of the case.

The TRRS connection will not work yet, as only ony one leg of the jack is connected. You can test this part later.

To begin, connect one half to your PC via USB. If you have RGB, observe the LEDs. Do they all light up? Are the colors correct, and can you see a rainbow animation play?

To test the switches, open [VIA](https://usevia.app/). After connecting to your device, switch to the key tester page using the stethoscope pictogram, then ativate the "Test Matrix" option. Now, you can connect each pair of switch pads in turn, using your tweezers, a wire, or a short length of solder.

Did they all light up? Great, proceed to case installation! Not quite perfect yet? Don't worry, proceed to the [Troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/help/troubleshooting.html) section!
