# Video build guides

If following a video guide is more convenient for you, you will find build guides on the youtube channel.

Please note, the hardware from the kit changes with time, so some details might not fit exactly.

If you are building a Skeletyl, Scylla or Dilemma, the process is overall the same. Just adjust number of keys and skip the trackball sensor installation.
