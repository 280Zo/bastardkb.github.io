# Introduction

Now that everything is connected together, the next step is to install the switches and the PCBs into the case. The process is exactly the same for both sides, so we will detail only the Scylla side (without trackball).

You may have noticed that we still haven't done anything with the sensor PCB. This is normal, we will connect it after installing the switches. This is so that it doesn't get in the way when soldering the switches.
