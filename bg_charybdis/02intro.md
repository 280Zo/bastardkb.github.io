# Introduction

In this online guide you will find how to build your Charybdis keyboard.

We recommend you start by reading the **required tools** section.

There are written guides, and there are also video guides in the **video guides** section.

The Charybdis keyboard is amongst the hardest keyboards to build out there, so we recommend carefully reading the instructions before building it.

If you have any issues or questions during the build, you can create a thread in the [discord][discord]'s #help forum.
