# Building locally

To build locally to preview changes, install ruby and ruby-bundler, change directory into the cloned repository, and ```bundle install``` to fetch all necessary parts.

Then, ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` to start a local web server, which will note the URL you should point your browser at in its output.
To enable live previewing as you make changes (just need to reload your browser), add `--incremental`.
